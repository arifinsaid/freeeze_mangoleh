								<h1>NEW CHILLS FOR SUMMER</h1>
								<span>By Admin on January 1st, 2021</span>
								<p>A frozen treat that tastes less like ice cream and more like actual yogurt. They offer just a few flavors, and then give customers a bevy of toppings. It tastes so good. It's very healthy. It's very refreshing and low in calories. Our product is actually authentic frozen yogurt. And, get your spoons ready for National Frozen Yogurt Day on February 6. Freeeze will be celebrating with a Buy One Swirl, Get One Free deal, good for an Original with toppings, of equal or lesser value. The promotion will be valid in stores and online. At Freeeze, guests can customize their swirl with a variety of toppings that include fresh, never frozen, fruit that is hand-cut in stores daily, along with premium granolas and nuts, and much more. Freeeze is swirling with possibilities!</p>

								<h1>BERRIES ON THE GROVE</h1>
								<span>By Admin on January 3rd, 2021</span>
								<p>Freeeze has only vanilla and green tea but offers nearly 20 toppings, ranging from kiwi to almonds to blackberries and mangos.The stores have drawn large crowds willing to wait in long lines to buy the frozen treats.Freeeze has done very little marketing, relying almost entirely on word of mouth.

    							When warm-weather adventures lead to the search for cooling treats, these new frozen yogurt flavors create a bright and refreshing taste reminiscent of classic, tropical drinks on the beach, no matter the location. The limited-edition offerings take inspiration from one of HI-CHEWâ„¢'s newest flavors, Fruit Blast, which debuted earlier this year within the Fruit Combos mix.</p>
